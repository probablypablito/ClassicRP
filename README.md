# ClassicRP
Rich Presence for Celeste Classic

Celeste Classic doesn't have Rich Presence, so I made one.

This cart does have Arbek in it, but no really good way to access it. If someone figures something out make a pull request or let me know.

This program not been tested on OSX/Linux. I coded it to not use any Windows specific instructions, but I might have messed up somewhere. If you run into issues let me know.

**TO USE**

1. Download and install Python 3.9+

2. Open a terminal and run the following commands: 
`pip install pypresence`
`pip install psutil`
`pip install easygui`

3. Drag and drop `ClassicRP.pyw` and `CelesteRPC.p8` to wherever your carts folder is. (`%appdata%\pico-8\carts` on Windows, and `$HOME\.lexaloffle\pico-8\carts` on OSX and Linux)

4. Make sure Discord is open

5. Launch `ClassicRP.pyw` making sure that it opens in the carts directory.
